## PLAN Mode Workflow

This command follows a **plan-approve-execute** pattern for comprehensive project planning.

### Phase 1: Analysis (Readonly)

**Analyze request:**
1. **Parse project description** - Understand scope and complexity
2. **Determine type** - Full application vs major feature
3. **Assess complexity** - Simple, medium, complex, enterprise
4. **Identify phases** - Research, planning, implementation, testing, deployment
5. **Calculate estimates** - Timeline, effort, resources needed

**Ask clarifying questions if needed:**
- What's the primary goal/problem this solves?
- Who are the target users?
- What's the technology stack preference (if any)?
- Any existing codebase to integrate with?
- Timeline and resource constraints?
- Key features (must-have vs nice-to-have)?
- Deployment environment and infrastructure?
- Team size and composition?
- Budget constraints?

**CRITICAL: Execution Mode Question**
After presenting the roadmap plan, **always ask**:

> "How would you like to proceed with task creation?
> 
> **Option A: One-by-One Processing** (Recommended for learning)
> - Review and approve each task as it's created
> - Understand each phase before moving forward
> - Interactive, step-by-step learning about your project
> - Best for: New projects, learning, thorough review
> 
> **Option B: Immediate Execution**
> - Generate all tasks at once after roadmap approval
> - Fast, automated task creation
> - Quick setup for experienced users
> - Best for: Well-understood projects, experienced teams
> 
> Which mode would you prefer? (A/B or 'one-by-one'/'immediate')"

**Wait for user choice before proceeding.**

**Read relevant files:**
- Existing roadmaps in `specs/todo-roadmap/`
- Project overview at `specs/00-overview.md`
- Templates at `.sdd/templates/`
- Similar projects for pattern matching

**Complexity detection criteria:**
- **Simple** (< 3 weeks): Single feature, small scope, 1-2 developers
- **Medium** (3-8 weeks): Multiple features, moderate complexity, small team
- **Complex** (8-20 weeks): Full application, high complexity, multiple teams
- **Enterprise** (> 20 weeks): Platform/system, very high complexity, large organization

### Phase 2: Planning (Create Plan Tool)

**Present detailed plan showing:**

1. **Project Analysis:**
   - Type: Application / Major Feature / System / Platform
   - Complexity: Simple / Medium / Complex / Enterprise
   - Estimated duration (timeline)
   - Team size recommendation
   - Recommended SDD approach (2.5 vs 2.0)

2. **Roadmap Structure Preview:**
   - Total epics/main tasks (count)
   - Total sub-tasks estimated
   - Phase organization (4-6 phases typical)
   - Critical path identification
   - Dependencies mapping

3. **Epic Breakdown (2-3 examples with subtasks):**
   ```
   Epic 1: Research & Foundation (Week 1-2)
   ├── Sub-task: Research existing patterns (8h)
   ├── Sub-task: Define requirements (16h)
   ├── Sub-task: Create technical specification (12h)
   └── Sub-task: Architecture design (16h)
   
   Epic 2: Core Development (Week 3-6)
   ├── Sub-task: Setup infrastructure (8h)
   ├── Sub-task: Implement backend API (40h)
   ├── Sub-task: Build frontend components (32h)
   └── Sub-task: Integration & testing (24h)
   
   Epic 3: Deployment & Launch (Week 7-8)
   ├── Sub-task: Performance optimization (16h)
   ├── Sub-task: Security hardening (12h)
   ├── Sub-task: Deployment setup (8h)
   └── Sub-task: Documentation & training (16h)
   ```

4. **File Structure to be created:**
   ```
   specs/todo-roadmap/[project-id]/
   ├── roadmap.json          # Kanban data (VSCode compatible)
   ├── roadmap.md            # Human-readable view
   ├── tasks/                # Individual task details
   │   ├── epic-001.json     # Epic task details
   │   ├── task-001-1.json   # Sub-task details
   │   └── ...
   └── execution-log.md      # Task execution tracking
   ```

5. **Integration Strategy:**
   - How main tasks map to SDD commands
   - Task execution workflow
   - Progress tracking mechanism
   - Link to `specs/active/` for implementation

6. **Success Metrics:**
   - How completion will be measured
   - Quality checkpoints
   - Review gates

**The plan should clearly show:**
- Complete project breakdown
- Realistic timeline and effort estimates
- Task dependencies and critical path
- Execution strategy

### Phase 3: Execution (After Approval AND Mode Selection)

**Once plan is approved AND user selects execution mode:**

#### Execution Mode A: One-by-One Processing (Interactive Learning)

**Workflow:**
1. **Create directory structure first:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p specs/todo-roadmap/[project-id]/tasks
   ```

2. **Create initial roadmap.json skeleton:**
   - Basic structure with metadata
   - Empty tasks object initially
   - Kanban columns setup
   - Statistics initialized to zeros

3. **For each epic/task (in order):**
   
   **a) Present task plan:**
   ```
   Next task to create: Epic 1 - Research & Foundation
   
   This epic includes:
   - Task 1-1: Research patterns (8h)
   - Task 1-2: Define architecture (16h)
   - Task 1-3: Create specification (16h)
   
   Total: 3 tasks, 40 hours
   SDD Phase: Research → Specification → Planning
   
   Create this epic now? (Yes/No/Skip)
   ```
   
   **b) Wait for user approval**
   
   **c) If approved:**
   - Generate task JSON files for this epic
   - Add to roadmap.json tasks object
   - Update roadmap.md with new epic
   - Show what was created
   - Update statistics
   - Ask if ready for next task
   
   **d) If skipped:**
   - Mark as "planned but not created yet"
   - Move to next task
   - Can come back later
   
   **e) User can also request:**
   - "Show me all remaining tasks first"
   - "Create all remaining tasks now" (switch to immediate mode)
   - "Let me review the roadmap so far"
   - "Pause and come back later"

4. **After each task creation:**
   - Update roadmap.md with new content
   - Show partial kanban board (what's created so far)
   - Display progress summary:
     ```
     Progress: 2/8 epics created
     Tasks created: 6
     Estimated hours: 80/240
     ```
   - Ask if ready for next task/epic

5. **Final step (when all tasks created):**
   - Create execution-log.md template
   - Update roadmap registry
   - Provide final summary and next steps

**Benefits:**
- Learn about each phase before it's created
- Understand dependencies and relationships
- Adjust tasks on-the-fly
- Review as you go
- Better understanding of project structure

#### Execution Mode B: Immediate Execution (Fast Setup)

**Workflow:**
1. **Create directory structure:**

   - Dependencies are logical
   - Estimates are reasonable
   - SDD commands properly mapped
   - JSON is valid and parseable

8. **Provide complete summary:**
   - Total epics, tasks, subtasks created
   - Timeline and effort estimates
   - Next steps for execution
   - Quick reference guide

**Benefits:**
- Fast, automated setup
- Complete roadmap ready immediately
- All tasks visible from start
- Better for experienced users
- Ready for team collaboration

#### Hybrid Option (Available During One-by-One)

**If user changes mind mid-process:**
```
You've created 3 of 8 epics so far.
Would you like to:
- Continue one-by-one (recommended)
- Switch to immediate mode (create remaining 5 epics now)
- Pause and review what we have so far
```

### Phase 4: Documentation

**For One-by-One Mode:**
After each task/epic creation:
- Show what was created
- Provide summary of current progress
- Display partial kanban board (what's created so far)
- Ask if ready for next task
- Provide option to switch modes

**For Immediate Mode:**
After complete roadmap creation:

### Task Type Mapping

Tasks automatically map to SDD commands based on type:

| Task Phase | SDD Command | Output |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Research | `/research` | research.md |
| Brief | `/brief` | feature-brief.md |
| Specification | `/specify` | spec.md |
| Planning | `/plan` | plan.md |
| Task Breakdown | `/tasks` | tasks.md |
| Implementation | `/implement` | todo-list.md + code |
| Evolution | `/evolve` | updates to docs |
| Upgrade | `/upgrade` | full SDD suite |

### Task Execution Workflow

Each task includes an execute command:
```bash
/execute-task epic-001
/execute-task task-001-1
```

**Execution process:**
1. Read task details from roadmap.json
2. Determine appropriate SDD command based on task.sdd.phase
3. Run SDD command with task context
4. Create spec in `specs/active/[task-id]/`
5. Update roadmap.json:
   - Set linkedSpec path
   - Update status (todo → in-progress → review → done)
   - Log execution time
6. Update execution-log.md with entry
7. Move task card in kanban columns

### Status Management

**Task Status Flow:**
```
todo → in-progress → review → done
  ↓         ↓           ↓
blocked  on-hold    archived
```

**Status Meanings:**
- **todo**: Ready to start, all dependencies met
- **in-progress**: Currently being worked on
- **review**: Completed, awaiting review
- **done**: Reviewed and approved
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed, has blocker
- **on-hold**: Paused temporarily
- **archived**: Cancelled or obsolete

### Dependency Management

Tasks can depend on other tasks:
```json
{
  "id": "task-002",
  "dependencies": ["task-001"],
  "status": "blocked"
}
```

System automatically:
- Prevents execution of dependent tasks until dependencies done
- Updates status when dependencies complete
- Shows dependency chain in roadmap.md

## Notes for AI Assistants

- **Always present plan first** with complete roadmap preview
- **CRITICAL: Always ask execution mode** after plan approval:
  - "One-by-One" (Option A) - Interactive, step-by-step learning
  - "Immediate" (Option B) - Fast, all-at-once creation
  - Wait for user's choice before proceeding
- **For One-by-One mode:**
  - Present each epic/task individually
  - Wait for approval before creating
  - Show progress after each creation
  - Allow switching to immediate mode mid-process
  - Provide pause/review options
- **For Immediate mode:**
  - Generate everything at once after approval
  - Create complete roadmap.json with all tasks
  - Generate all task JSON files
  - Provide comprehensive summary
- **Detect complexity automatically** using multiple indicators
- **Create hierarchical structure** with proper parent-child relationships
- **Generate VSCode-compatible JSON** following Taskr Kanban format
- **Wait for approval AND mode selection** before creating any files
- **Respect user preference** - don't skip the execution mode question
- **Link to SDD commands** for each task execution
- **Track progress** meticulously in execution log
- **Validate dependencies** ensure logical task ordering
- **Estimate realistically** use historical data when possible
- **Document thoroughly** all decisions and rationale

## Integration with VSCode Extensions

The roadmap.json format is designed to be compatible with:
- Taskr Kanban extension
- Custom SDD kanban extensions
- Generic JSON-based project management tools

See [ROADMAP_FORMAT_SPEC.md](../../.sdd/ROADMAP_FORMAT_SPEC.md) for complete JSON schema specification.
